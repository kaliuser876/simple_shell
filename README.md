# simple_shell
A simple shell that runs on Linux machines. This utilizes buffers to read each character, pass it over to a tokenizer, then execute the tokens. I am in the process of implementing more commands, but this is a strong foundation.

To complie and run this program you will need to use a linux machine, and have a C compiler

 Create a file and name it simple_shell.c (or download the file from github)

 Take the source code and paste it in

 Assuming you have a c compiler you will be able to run
     -- gcc simple_shell.c -o run.exe

Then run the program
    -- ./run.exe

You have successfully complied and ran my program. I am still working on adding more commands, but I wanted to get this on git!
